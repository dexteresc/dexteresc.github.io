# Hi there, I'm Jonathan ðŸ‘‹

I like anything that makes my life easier, which is why I love Typescript, Java, and Golang. I also really dislike bad design, so I'm always striving to create beautiful and clean code. Currently, I'm studying systems science in LuleÃ¥, and I would love to work in a field where I can help create efficient and well-designed systems.
